# catan-board-generator

Catan Randomizer generates a random game board for the Catan board game detailing which hexagon will have Wood, Ore, Hay, Sheep, Brick and a desert. It will also assign a number (between 1-12 excluding 7 which is reserved for robber) to each of the hexagons excluding desert which will have a robber on it at the beginning of the game.
